# Automobile-Prediction using Machine Learning in Python

## Project Overview: 
This project explores the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook dataset using predictive modeling techniques to analyze car specifications, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses. It aims to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data, providing valuable insights for various applications.

## Goals:
* Develop machine learning models to predict 'insurance risk ratings' and average expected 'price' for different car categories.
* Identify key features influencing car riskiness and loss patterns.
* Gain practical experience with popular machine learning algorithms.
* Showcase effective data exploration and visualization techniques.

## Methodology:
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, exploring, and transforming the Automobile_data.csv dataset.
* Model Selection and Training: Experimenting with various algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualization and Interpretation: Generating insightful visualizations to interpret model results and understand driving factors.

## Project Files:
* automobile-prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the core analysis and modeling code.
* Data Science- Major Project.pdf: Project background, theoretical context, and detailed methodology explanation.
* Automobile_data.csv: Raw dataset containing car specifications, risk ratings, price and normalized losses etc.
