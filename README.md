# Automobile Prediction using Machine Learning and Python

![](automobile.jpg)

## Project Overview
This project delves into the world of automobile insurance risk assessment using a unique dataset from the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook. The data offers a comprehensive picture of various car characteristics, along with assigned insurance risk ratings and normalized loss information and has the potential to be beneficial for both insurance companies and consumers. Insurance companies could utilize the model to refine their risk assessment processes, leading to more accurate pricing. Consumers, on the other hand, could gain valuable insights into the potential insurance costs associated with different cars before making a purchase. The project aims to leverage this data to develop a predictive model. This model will analyze the car's specifications and predict its insurance risk rating and potential losses. 

## Data Sources
The data for this project originates from Unschool, accessed during my basic data science coursework. The dataset is included within this repository üëâ[Automobile_data.csv](https://github.com/Thadkapally-Saikiran/Automobile-Prediction/blob/main/Automobile_data.csv)

## Problem Statement
1. Predicting Insurance Risk and Cost
   - Develop machine learning models to predict both categorical insurance risk ratings and continuous average expected insurance prices for various car categories.
2. Understanding Key Risk Factors
   - Identify the most important features from the car data that significantly influence insurance risk ratings and loss patterns. This will help insurance companies understand which car characteristics are most relevant for accurate risk assessment.
3. Machine Learning Exploration
   - Gain practical experience with a variety of popular machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in this specific context.
4. Model Performance Evaluation
   -  Assess the effectiveness of the developed models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This will help determine the most accurate and reliable model for predicting insurance risk and cost.
5. Data Visualization and Interpretation
   - Create clear and informative visualizations to effectively communicate the findings of the machine learning models. This will help explain the driving factors behind the predicted insurance risk and cost for different car categories.

## Skills/Concepts Demonstrated
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Data Cleaning Techniques (handling missing values, outliers)
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistical methods and visualization libraries
   - Data Transformation (scaling, encoding categorical variables)

2. Data Visualization:
   - Libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn for creating informative visualizations
     - Understanding relationships between features and target variables
   
4. Machine Learning Techniques:

   - Logistic Regression (for predicting categorical target variable - risk rating)
   - Decision Trees
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Naive Bayes
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Random Forest
5. Model Training & Evaluation:
   - Train-Test Splitting
   - Performance Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Recommendations
- Focus on safety features:
  - The analysis shows that car features such as wheelbase, length, width, and height are important factors influencing insurance risk ratings. This suggests that designing cars with these features in mind,  could lead to lower insurance premiums for consumers. Manufacturers should prioritize incorporating safety features like anti-lock braking systems (ABS), electronic stability control (ESC), and airbags into their vehicles.
- Improve fuel efficiency:
  - Fuel efficiency is another significant factor affecting insurance costs.  Car manufacturers should invest in research and development to improve the fuel efficiency of their cars. This will not only benefit consumers by lowering insurance premiums but also reduce environmental impact.
- Develop telematics technology:
  - Telematics is a technology that uses data from a vehicle's sensors to track its location, mileage, and driving behavior.  This data can be used by insurance companies to provide more personalized rates to drivers.  Car manufacturers could look into embedding telematics technology into their cars as an optional feature. This would allow insurance companies to offer pay-as-you-drive policies to responsible drivers, further reducing insurance costs.
- Partner with insurance companies:
  - Car manufacturers can partner with insurance companies to develop data-driven safety programs.  These programs could offer discounts to consumers who choose cars with certain safety features or who opt to enroll in telematics-based insurance programs.
By following these recommendations, the automobile industry can work together with insurance companies to make cars safer and more affordable for consumers.
