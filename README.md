# Automobile-Prediction using Machine Learning in Python

## Project Overview
This project delves into the world of automobile insurance risk assessment using a unique dataset from the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook. The data offers a comprehensive picture of various car characteristics, along with assigned insurance risk ratings and normalized loss information and has the potential to be beneficial for both insurance companies and consumers. Insurance companies could utilize the model to refine their risk assessment processes, leading to more accurate pricing. Consumers, on the other hand, could gain valuable insights into the potential insurance costs associated with different cars before making a purchase. The project aims to leverage this data to develop a predictive model. This model will analyze the car's specifications and predict its insurance risk rating and potential losses. 

## Data Sources
The data for this project originates from Unschool, accessed during my basic data science coursework. The dataset is included within this repository ðŸ‘‰[Automobile_data.csv]()

## Goals:
* Develop machine learning models to predict 'insurance risk ratings' and average expected 'price' for different car categories.
* Identify key features influencing car riskiness and loss patterns.
* Gain practical experience with popular machine learning algorithms.
* Showcase effective data exploration and visualization techniques.

## Methodology:
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, exploring, and transforming the Automobile_data.csv dataset.
* Model Selection and Training: Experimenting with various algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualization and Interpretation: Generating insightful visualizations to interpret model results and understand driving factors.

## Project Files:
* automobile-prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the core analysis and modeling code.
* Data Science- Major Project.pdf: Project background, theoretical context, and detailed methodology explanation.
* Automobile_data.csv: Raw dataset containing car specifications, risk ratings, price and normalized losses etc.
  
This project provides a comprehensive framework for exploring the Automobile_data.csv dataset through predictive modeling, offering valuable learning opportunities and potential for further research and application.
